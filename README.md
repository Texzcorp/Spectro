## Notes: 
- Ensure you have an active internet connection while downloading wallpapers.
- When initiating a new download, all previous wallpapers will be removed.
- A larger number of wallpapers to download will provide a greater variety of images daily but will increase download time.
- **Spectro searches for wallpapers based on keywords, similar to a Google image search. Therefore, if your search terms are too specific, it may lead to unexpected results. Including broader terms like "art" can help avoid poor-quality or unattractive images; for example, "Rick and Morty art" is preferable to just "Rick and Morty."**
